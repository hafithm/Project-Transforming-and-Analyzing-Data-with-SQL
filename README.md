# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

- My main goal in this project is to clean the data as much as I can with the time given. Get rid of null values, duplicatees, redundancy and irrelevant columns. This step is crucial for upmost accuracy and analysis. From there I can understand the purpose of the database and figure out what the data is entailing. 
- Another goal is to combine the different tables and find if they're related in anyway. 
- Data Integration in the all_sessions table to the analytics table and combine ideas such as the tractionrevenues and product details. The e-commerce database is important because it helps the online business track and find better ways to identify patterns that can increase revenue. By analyzing the data in the database, the business can gain valuable insights to make smarter decisions, improve the customer experience, and ultimately make more money.





## Results

- Upon analyzing the ecommerce database several valuable insights can be obtained to answer the questions provided. After examing the transaction data it becomes possible to identify the  cities and countries that contribute to the most revenue generated. In this database it happened  to be the USA and this can help make sense of the geographical  distribution and can guide marketing strategies. 
- By examining the sales data, I determined the best-selling product in each city or country. This analysis helps in understanding customer preferences and identifying popular product categories. In countries such as the USA it became apparent that they purchased more jackets and  onesie's compared to counties such as Columbia and Brazil. Alongside those findings, I came up with a question that I found to be important for the companies growth. The data can be used to identify the most frequent viewed pages which can  help in changing the user's experience by giving more importance to that specific content. 
-  From the sales_report tale we can use the information provided to answer the question "How many products have a stock level greater than 1?" This information is valuable for inventory management as it allows us to identify the number of products that are currently available in  stock and can be sold. By knowing the count of products with a stock level greater than 1, we can assess the availability of products and make decisions regarding restocking. 


## Challenges 

- Dealing with inaccurate or missing information for cities in the data presented one of the biggest obstacles during the project. This presented aÂ challenge in trying to evaluate and extract meaning from the data. It leaves holes in it and makes it more difficult to completely comprehend consumer behaviour all together.

- Generating revenue from the analytics table and using other tables like the products table to compute it.  This can present some challenges especailly in cleaning.




## Future Goals

- Identify more of the missing values in cleaning and change that accordingly.

- Find more connections with the all_sessions table and sales_report table as well. I didn't spend much time with the sales_report table. Moreover I would analyze 

- Know the relationship between the different tables more in depth. This could mean examing the tables more that are related to the time on the site or the transactions as well.
