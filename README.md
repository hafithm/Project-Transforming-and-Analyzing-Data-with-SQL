# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

My main goal in this project is to clean the data as much as I can with the time given. Get rid of null values, duplicatees and redundancy and irrelevant columns an 

information. This step is crucial for upmost accuracy and analysis. From there I can understand the purpose of the database and figure out what the data is entailing. 

Another goal is to combine the different tables and find if they're related in anyway. Data Integration in the all_sessions table to the analytics table and combine ideas 

such as the tractionrevenues and product details. The e-commerce database is important because it helps a the online business track and find better ways to identify patterns 

that can increase revenue. By analyzing the data in the database, the business can gain valuable insights to make smarter decisions, improve the customer experience, and 

ultimately make more money.





## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

Upon analyzing the ecommerce database several valuable insights can be obtained to answer the questions provided. After examing the transaction data it becomes possible to 

identify the cities and countries that contribute to the most revenue generated. In this database it happened to be the USA and this can help make sense of the geographical 

distribution and can guide marketing strategies. By examining the sales data, I determined the best-selling product in each city or country. This analysis helps in 

understanding customer preferences and identifying popular product categories. In countries such as the USA it became apparent that they purchased more jackets and onesie's 

compared to counties such as Columbia and Brazil. Alongside those findings, I came up with a question that I found to be important for the companies growth. The data can be 

used to identify the most frequent viwed pages which can help in changing the user's experiencing by giving more importance to that content. Also, from the sales_report tale 

we can use the information provided to answer the question "How many products have a stock level greater than 1?" This information is valuable for inventory management 

as it allows us to identify the number of products that are currently available in stock and can be sold. By knowing the count of products with a stock level 

greater than 1, we can assess the availability of products and make decisions regarding restocking.

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)

I would identify more of the missing values in cleaning and chnage that accordingly.
